# simple JAXB example with EJB binding

I had a lot of problems in a JAXB project to establish a custom EJB binding using the `XmlAdapter`.
For this reason I created this sample project. Feel free to reuse my code.

## Build

```bash
$ mvn clean compile #generates the jaxb-classes and build the project
```

```bash
$ mvn clean test #run the tests
```
